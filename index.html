                    I feel the programs offered are excellent!  Look…, I’m 65 years old.  The older you are the more difficult it is to learn a language but this is not a “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks” deal.  I started beginner’s French about 3 years ago and off and on again I’ve continued to where I’m now in a Pre-Advanced class. I’ll probably never be fluent but I know (because I’ve done it) I can go to France and communicate pretty well with people.  I learn something new each class.  The instructors are committed, they’re patient (they’ve got to be with me…) and if you’re willing to learn…you’ll learn

                    I have come to ILI for two summers to study French. I have attended private classes with Marie Claire. The time has been invaluable, positive, fun and very educational. Marie Claire is creative as well as very personable and engaging. The class time flies by. Francisco is also very helpful about scheduling convenient lessons with an appropriate instructor. He is also flexible about changes in a private lesson schedule. I plan to return to my studies at ILI next summer if not before.
